-- Answer to question "1. General understanding of the problem"

Goal is to find mcs of the two lists of ints. It is given
from the instructions that the mcs length is 4. The mcs is also given as [3,2,3,9].
[3,2,8,2,3,9,4,3,9]
[1,3,2,3,7,9]

[-, 3, 2, 8, 2, 3, 9, 4, 3, 9]
[1, 3, 2, -, -, 3, 7, -, -, 9]

In the two lists above we have 4 matches so lets set 
scoreMatch = 1. If we set the other two parameters to 
0 we would get the score 4 which corresponds to the mcs length.

Lets test it:
optAlignments' "328239439" "132379"
[("-328239439","13--23--79"),("-328239439","132--3--79"),("-32823943-9","13--2---379"),("-32823943-9","132-----379"),("-32823943-9","13--23---79"),("-32823943-9","132--3---79"),("-328239439","13--23-7-9"),("-328239439","132--3-7-9"),("-3282394-39","13--23--7-9"),("-3282394-39","132--3--7-9"),("-328239439","13--237--9"),("-328239439","132--37--9"),("-328239-439","13--23-7--9"),("-328239-439","132--3-7--9"),("-32823-9439","13--237---9"),("-32823-9439","132--37---9"),("-32823-9439","13--2379---"),("-32823-9439","132--379---")]

If we are correct(the matching *) should be present in the above. This is the case.
This means that if we want to extract the mcs we could use optAlignments' and take the first
pair. Lets pick ("-328239439","13--23--79"). Then a function should extract the matching elements
into a list as follows:

- 3 2 8 2 3 9 4 3 9
1 3 - - 2 3 - - 7 9

  3     2 3       9    = [3,2,3,9] the same as in the instructions.
